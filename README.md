# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hello, I'm Pablo, a Software Engineer specialized in Android Development with a strong background in Web Development and Data Science. My diverse experience allows me to approach mobile development with a comprehensive understanding of software architecture, data handling, and user experience.

## ðŸš€ Engineering Philosophy & Expertise

I build software following solid engineering principles and best practices:

- **Architecture Patterns**: Extensive experience with MVVM and MVI architectures, ensuring clean separation of concerns and maintainable codebases
- **SOLID Principles**: Strong advocate for SOLID principles in software design, creating robust and scalable applications
- **Clean Architecture**: Implementation of clean architecture patterns, separating business logic from implementation details
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing strategies including unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Deep understanding of OOP concepts and their practical application
- **Reactive Programming**: Experience with reactive patterns and state management
- **CI/CD**: Implementation of automated testing and deployment pipelines
