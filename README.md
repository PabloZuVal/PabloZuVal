# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hello, I'm Pablo, a software developer transitioning into the fascinating world of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. With a solid background in programming, I'm excited to apply my skills and knowledge to the field of Artificial Intelligence.

## My journey in machine learning

Currently, I'm immersed in learning the most advanced techniques and tools in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Some of the topics I'm exploring include:

- Artificial Neural Networks
- Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Data Analysis and Visualization

I'm constantly seeking opportunities to apply these concepts to real-world projects and collaborate with other machine learning enthusiasts.
